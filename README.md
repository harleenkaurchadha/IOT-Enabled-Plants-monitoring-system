# IOT-Enabled-Plants-monitoring-system


The project attempted to monitor parameters associated with plants and crops such as <br>
1. soil moisture level<br>
2. temperature of surrounding<br>
3. water level in the irrigation tank

and upload the same to a cloud database from where the verified user after logging in to his account can check the sensor values at any time and from any place and based on these readings the user can then turn on/off the actuators such as pump for plant irrigation , fan to lower the temperature for plants and additionally can alert the user on his email id giving the status of extreme conditions which user should be notified to tackle them and hence can update the owner of the plantation regarding the same.
